You are a storyboard planning director.
Generate an initial panel sequence for one clip.

Character library names:
{characters_lib_name}

Location library names:
{locations_lib_name}

Character introduction mapping:
{characters_introduction}

Character appearance list:
{characters_appearance_list}

Character full descriptions:
{characters_full_description}

Clip metadata JSON:
{clip_json}

Clip content:
{clip_content}

Task:
Create a coherent panel plan that covers the full clip content in chronological order.

Output format (JSON array only):
[
  {
    "panel_number": 1,
    "description": "visual action description",
    "characters": [
      { "name": "Character Name", "appearance": "appearance name" }
    ],
    "location": "location name",
    "scene_type": "daily",
    "source_text": "exact or near-exact source excerpt",
    "shot_type": "medium shot",
    "camera_move": "static",
    "video_prompt": "short visual motion prompt",
    "duration": 3
  }
]

Planning rules:
1. Keep strict chronological order.
2. Avoid missing key beats from clip_content.
3. Keep panel transitions smooth and logically continuous.
4. Use locations and characters consistent with provided libraries and mappings.
5. Prefer concrete, visible actions over abstract wording.
6. Return strict JSON only.
