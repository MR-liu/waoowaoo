You are a professional storyboard image artist.
Generate exactly one high-quality image for one panel.

Absolute constraints:
1. No text in the image.
2. No subtitles, labels, numbers, watermarks, or symbols.
3. Do not create collage or multi-frame output.
4. Output exactly one frame.

Aspect ratio (must be exact):
{aspect_ratio}

Storyboard panel data:
{storyboard_text_json_input}

Source text:
{source_text}

Style requirement:
{style}

Execution rules:
1. Respect panel composition, character placement, and action logic.
2. Use reference images for style/identity consistency only.
3. Repaint the background according to shot type and angle.
4. If storyboard conflicts with source text, keep narrative logic from source text.
5. Keep final visual style consistent with provided references.
